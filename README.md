# Portfolio Version 1.0 Readme

After 3 Hours of Continuous Development

## Overview

Welcome to the first version of my personal portfolio website! This project was developed over the course of 3 hours, utilizing HTML and CSS to create a simple and stylish online portfolio. The portfolio is built using semantic HTML, making it accessible and search engine friendly. The design incorporates different sections to showcase my skills, projects, and a brief about me.

## Key Features

- **Semantic HTML:** The portfolio is structured using semantic HTML elements, ensuring a clear and meaningful layout while improving accessibility and SEO optimization.

- **Stylish Design:** The design of the portfolio is crafted to be visually appealing , inspired from scrimba and user-friendly. Careful consideration was given to the color scheme, typography, and overall layout.

- **Three Sections:**

  1. **About Me:** This section provides a brief introduction about myself, highlighting my background, skills, and areas of expertise.

  2. **Skills:** In this section, I've highlighted my key skills and competencies. It offers a quick overview of the technologies I'm proficient in.

  3. **Projects:** The projects section showcases some of my notable works. Each project is presented with a title, description, and relevant links or images.

- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well on various screen sizes and devices.

- **CSS States:** Interactive elements like buttons and links have been styled to include different CSS states such as hover and active, enhancing the user experience.

## Installation

Since this is a front-end project involving only HTML and CSS, you can simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DivvSaxena/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

## Usage

Feel free to customize the content and styling according to your preferences. You can modify the existing sections, add new ones, update the project details, and experiment with different styles.

## Future Plans

This version of the portfolio serves as a starting point. In future iterations, I plan to:

- Add more projects to the portfolio, showcasing a wider range of skills and experiences.

- Experiment with JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic elements.

- Implement a contact form to allow visitors to get in touch easily.

## Feedback

I would greatly appreciate any feedback you have about the portfolio. Whether it's about the design, usability, or any bugs you come across, your insights will help me improve and refine the portfolio further.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio!
